<h1>Context</h1>
Must be compatible with React Native, minimal dependencies, easy to use and maintain, have a good community, be well documented and have a good performance.
<h1>Decision</h1>
The team is already familiar with Node.js and the programming language is compatible with React Native and the platform itself is secure and stable. The language comes with comprehensive documentation and the large community enables access to support and resources.
<h1>Consequences</h1>
Node.js will result in slower performance as the language is single threaded.
