<h1>Context</h1>
Must provide real time order tracking, integration with multiple payment gateways, integrate with restaurant inventory management, provide order history, keep users informed about order confirmations, delivery updates, and promotional offers.<br/>
<h1>Decision</h1>
Build the app as a hybrid app. Provides greatest market reach and enables easy access to third party resources (payment, notification and real-time tracking). Also enables user friendly UI on all devices. <br/>
<h1>Consequences</h1>
Hybrid apps are slower than native apps and more expensive than web apps to develop and deploy. There will likely be some difficulty in making the app intuitive for all users. The performance of the app will be somewhat slower than a native app and a higher user requirement than a web app but will have a good mix of easy to use UI and performance.
